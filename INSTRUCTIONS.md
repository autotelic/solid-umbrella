Autotelic Fullstack Developer Test
==================================

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test! It consists of two parts:

* [A coding test](#coding-test)
* [A few follow-up questions](#follow-up-questions)

## Coding Test

The task for this test is to create either a web application in Javascript, using any libraries or frameworks you like. The intent of this exercise is to give you a chance to demonstrate your strengths while approaching the problem. To choose appropriate libraries or frameworks, you could think about the type of work you would like to do at Autotelic as well as how best you can showcase your development skills.

We generally recommend candidates donâ€™t spend any longer than 4 hours on the exercise - we know your time is valuable as well. However ideally your test submission should meet these requirements:

* The application should use the [Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api). You can use the publicly available API at https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke or run it locally using docker following the instructions below.
* The application should satisfy at least one of the user stories below.
* Provide clear instructions in a README markdown file on how to build and run the application, and steps for a reviewer to verify the user story or stories you have completed (or attempted).
* Ensure your application builds and runs without errors.
* Approach the project as you would a professional piece of work - assume your future colleagues will be working on it and maintaining it.
* Please include some tests.
* Answer the follow-up questions.
* Submit your test by [forking this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

### Run the API Locally Using Docker

* Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
* In a terminal window, from the root directory of the repo, run `docker compose up`.

### User Stories

> As a **user running the application**
> I can **view a random joke**
> So that **I can be amused**

> As a **user running the application**
> I can **click through to see the punchline of a joke**
> So that **it's more like being told a real joke**

> As a **user running the application**
> I can **filter the joke displayed by type**
> So that **I can be amused by a joke more suited to my sense of humor**

> As a **user running the application**
> I can **choose to see a larger number of random jokes at one time**
> So that **I can be more amused**

> As a **user running the application**
> I can **choose to see a larger number of random jokes at one time, filtered by type**
> So that **I can be more amused by jokes more suited to my sense of humor**

## Follow-up Questions

Please answer the following questions in an appropriately named markdown file.

1. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
2. What's a language feature of node/javascript that you really like? Please highlight in your code where you've used it and why.
3. What previous experience do you have with the libraries or frameworks you chose? Would you chose different libraries or frameworks if you were doing the test again? Why?
4. What do you think you would need to do to make your code production ready?
5. How long did you spend on the test?

Thanks!
